ICFP 2011 programming contest solution.
http://www.icfpcontest.org/2011/06/task-description-contest-starts-now.html

Done:
- LTG simulator, with some level of IO compatibility with official one.

TODO:
- Robots with simple strategies

Maybe TODO:
- Silent mode (-silent True)
- Match server
- Advanced strategies selectable at runtime
- Lambda expression translator


My actual goal is to learn Haskell, and LTG seems to be a good problem for
this. Quality of code might be a bit low, since it's my first non-trivial
Haskell program )
